# QuickKYC Timeout Fix Implementation

## Problem
The QuickKYC application was experiencing timeout issues on Google App Engine because the main processing function (`__main__()`) takes up to 5 minutes to complete, which exceeds App Engine's request timeout limits.

## Solution
Implemented **background processing with client-side polling** - the cheapest solution that requires no additional Google Cloud services.

## How It Works

### 1. Background Job System
- **In-memory job tracking**: Uses a simple dictionary (`active_jobs`) with thread-safe operations
- **Job lifecycle**: starting → processing → completed/error
- **Automatic cleanup**: Jobs older than 1 hour are automatically removed

### 2. New Endpoints
- **`POST /run_main`**: Starts background processing, returns job ID immediately
- **`GET /job_status/<job_id>`**: Shows job status page with progress
- **`GET /api/job_status/<job_id>`**: API endpoint for real-time status updates
- **`GET /job_download/<job_id>`**: Downloads completed results

### 3. User Experience
1. User clicks "Process Files"
2. Processing starts in background (returns immediately, no timeout)
3. User is redirected to status page showing:
   - Real-time progress updates
   - Spinning animation while processing
   - Automatic refresh every 2 seconds
4. When complete, download button appears
5. Files are automatically cleaned up after download

### 4. Key Features
- **No external dependencies**: Uses only Python threading
- **Thread-safe**: All job operations are protected with locks
- **Auto-cleanup**: Memory and file cleanup after completion
- **Error handling**: Graceful error messages if processing fails
- **Real-time updates**: Progress bar and status messages
- **User-friendly**: Clear visual feedback throughout the process

## Cost Impact
**$0** - This solution uses only:
- Python threading (included)
- In-memory storage (included)
- Standard App Engine requests (no additional cost)

## Files Modified
1. **`app.py`**: Added background processing system and new endpoints
2. **`templates/index.html`**: Modified form submission to use AJAX
3. **`templates/job_status.html`**: New status page with progress tracking

## Deployment
No additional configuration needed. The solution works within existing App Engine limits and uses only standard Python libraries.

## Benefits
- ✅ Eliminates timeout errors
- ✅ Zero additional cost
- ✅ Better user experience with real-time feedback
- ✅ Automatic cleanup of resources
- ✅ Thread-safe and reliable
- ✅ No external service dependencies
